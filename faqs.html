            <h2>What does 1 yard of gravel weigh?</h2>
            <p>1 yard = 1.5 tons = 3000 lbs.</p>
            <h2>How do you calculate how much material you need?</h2>
            <p>Width (in feet) x Length (in feet) x Depth (in feet) = Area divided by 27. This will give you the amount of material needed in cubic yards.</p>
            <h2>What is the area of 1 cubic yard?</h2>
            <p>Think of it like a cube - 3 feet wide by 3 feet high by 3 feet deep.</p>

            <p>Single axle dump truck = 5 yards/7.5 tons /15,000 lbs.<br>

            <h2>What's the difference between 3/4" Limestone Traffic Bond and 3/4" Crushed Road Gravel?</h2>
            <p>Limestone is dolomite which grey-white in color, has been crushed to gradated pieces no larger than 3/4 of an inch and has hard packing capabilities when properly compacted. Gravel is brown in color, has been crushed to gradated pieces no larger than 3/4 of an inch and has good packing capabilities when properly compacted.  They can both be used as base materials, but depending on the project one might be better than the other for the specific application.</p>            
            <h2>Where can I see residential products on display?</h2>
            <p>All of our materials are available for viewing at our Crowbar Road residential facility. (6600 Crowbar Road, Muskego 53150)</p>
            <h2>What material would you recommend for a riding arena?</h2>

            <h2>What is the best gravel for a driveway?</h2>
            <p>There are a few products suitable for driveways. Recycled concrete, recycled asphalt or 3/4" limestone traffic bond. Gravel is another good option, but might have some drawbacks as far as a water absorption.<br>Note: If you are using material as a base and having concrete or asphalt poured, please check with your contractor.</p>
            <h2>What is the best sand for under a pool liner?</h2>
